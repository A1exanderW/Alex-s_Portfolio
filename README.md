# [Project 1 : Pokemon game](www.theage.com.au)
This was the 1st assignment for CSSE1001 (2016). It is a simple text based program which is based on Ash finding pikachu in a maze loaded from a text file. Spaces represent open squares, and # represent the walls of the maze. The player can move in directions N,S,E or W and can only make a valid move if the next square is open. Enemy pokemon (Z-Zubat and D-Doduo) are placed through the map that will cause the player to instantly lose if encountered.

#[Project 2:  Tiles game] (www.theage.com.au)
This was the 3rd assignment for CSSE1001 (2016). It is a tile-matching game in which the player aims to swap tiles to form runs and earn points, which in turn inflicts damage on the enemy,The longer the run the more points. A damage bonus system involving the attack type and defender type (similar to the system in Nintendo's Pokemon)is implemented


#[Project 3:  Tesla powerwall datalogger] (www.theage.com.au)
This program uses Selenium to interact with web base browser and continuously retrieve key parameters from the tesla battery and solar inverter system. These parameters include battery load (kW), battery draw (kW), solar generated (kW), Solar to grid (kW) and GHG emissions saved per inverval (tCO2). The openpyxl package is employed to open an existing excel file, insert data and save the file.
